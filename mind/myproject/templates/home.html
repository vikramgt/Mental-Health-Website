            <p ><br> Mental health encompasses a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It involves the ability to handle stress, maintain healthy relationships, think clearly, and cope with life's challenges effectively. Good mental health allows individuals to set and achieve goals, enjoy life, seek help when needed, balance work and play, practice self-care, and build resilience. It's a dynamic state that fluctuates over time, and maintaining it requires a combination of self-care, social support, and, when necessary, professional help. </p></div>

            <p>Preventing suicide is closely tied to addressing mental health. Suicide ranks as the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds, and severe mental health conditions can lead to premature mortality. Stigma and discrimination persist, and the treatment gap remains wide, despite cost-effective solutions. Increased investment is crucial for awareness, access to care, and research. WHO's Special Initiative for Mental Health (2019-2023) aims to provide quality mental health care to an additional 100 million people in 12 priority countries, highlighting the urgency of this issue.</p></div>
